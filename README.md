# Hi There ðŸ‘‹
## About me
15 y. o., fullstack developer in C++, Java, JS down the line. Sometimes I learn economy and fundamentals of business. I really love programming, but for me that's also an opportunity to build my future enterprise in IT and write some basics for it.
## I learn...
A little bit of everything -- databases, safety, architecture of backend and frontend... yeah, everything that related to web (well, except of system administration). Web is my life, man.
## I work on...
- Jessenger (a.k.a. J-chat, a.k.a. Blip). You can find that in my profile. That's a little fast messenger created with C++ (Qt Framework) and Java (Spring). I've been working on it solo, but I'll be happy if someone helps me.

- 27. That's a roguelike-multiplayer game with post-ironic charisma. You CAN'T find that in my profile now (unless you aren't part of out team), but we're planning to publish it in april. I am the team leader on this project. Our team has nine members.
## Collaborations
I'd be thrilled to collaborate, talk, advise or getting advised. Contacts:
